Being stuck in a job that constantly takes your time can deplete your life.  
Working non-traditional hours, covering shifts because of the turnover rates and being stuck in a job culture that overlooks the issues of not being able to retain employees was the catalyst of seeking  something that can give me more alternatives to earning income that does not suck the life out of your time.  I needed something that can empower me to accomplish this goal. Needed to upgrade my skillsets.  
​
Enter coding bootcamps. 
 Seeing the value bootcamps had to offer vs going to a brick and mortar school was an eye opener. 
 New paradigm shifts were here in education and a way of doing things.  
Just like Uber, Lyft, Amazon and  Air BnB offered a more suitable way changing the landscapes of businesses so does coding bootcamps.  
​
Education is important and by no means am I downplaying or degrading traditional brick and mortar campuses. 
 ***But what aligns with and can better meet your goals should always take precedence***. 
 Brick and mortar schools will teach you other subjects that you will have to pay for.  
They already gotten paid when you started the class.  So their incentive to find you work after graduating drops. 
 Coding bootcamps via thru Income Shared Agreements are more  aligned with getting you a job because they get paid when you get paid.
   So their courses, motivation and incentives are geared to you having a higher percentage in being successful and finding work. 
 That's a win - win situation for both yourself and the coding bootcamp. 
 *An ethical way of doing business where both parties win*.   
Thats a no brainer.
